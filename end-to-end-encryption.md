## Overview

To implement end-to-end encryption with Phoenix LiveView, you would need to use a library such as OpenSSL or a third-party solution such as Virgil Security.

Here is a rough outline of how this could be implemented in a LiveView chat application:

    In the chat application, each user would have a public and private key pair. The private key would be stored securely on the user's device, while the public key would be shared with the server and other users.

    When a user sends a message, the message would be encrypted using the recipient's public key. This would ensure that only the intended recipient, who has the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the message.

    The encrypted message would be sent to the server, which would then forward it to the recipient.

    The recipient's LiveView would receive the encrypted message and use the private key to decrypt it. The decrypted message would then be displayed to the user.

Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented using the OpenSSL library:

```elixir
# Generate a public/private key pair for the sender
{public_key, private_key} = :public_key.generate_key_pair()

# Encrypt the message using the recipient's public key
encrypted_message = :public_key.encrypt(recipient_public_key, message)

# Decrypt the message using the recipient's private key
decrypted_message = :public_key.decrypt(private_key, encrypted_message)
```

The decrypt_password function would likely be used to decrypt the user's private key, which is stored securely on the user's device. This function would take the encrypted private key and the user's password as inputs, and return the decrypted private key. This private key can then be used to decrypt messages sent to the user.

# Decrypt the private key using the user's password

```elixir
private_key = decrypt_password(encrypted_private_key, password)
```

Note that this is just a high-level overview of how end-to-end encryption could be implemented with Phoenix LiveView, and there are many details and complexities that would need to be considered in a real-world implementation.

## Implemntation

### Securely storing the private key

To use the Web Cryptography API in a Phoenix LiveView app, you would need to create a LiveView page with a form where the user can enter their message, and a button to encrypt and send the message. The form could include a text field for the message and a password field for the encryption key.

When the user clicks the encrypt button, the LiveView would handle the form submission and generate a new encryption key using the Elixir Crypto module. It would then encrypt the message using the key and the Web Cryptography API, and send the encrypted message to the server.

On the server side, the Phoenix application would receive the encrypted message and store it in the database. To decrypt the message, the user would need to enter the correct password on the LiveView page, which would be used to generate the encryption key. The LiveView would then use the Web Cryptography API to decrypt the message and display it to the user.

To securely store the key on the user's device, you could use the window.localStorage API in JavaScript. This would allow you to store the key in the user's browser, where it would be accessible only to your app and only on the same device. You could also use a library like js-cookie to add additional security measures, such as encrypting the key before storing it in local storage.

Overall, the process of implementing end-to-end encryption with Phoenix LiveView and the Web Cryptography API would involve the following steps:

1. Create a LiveView page with a form for entering the message and
   password.
2. When the user submits the form, generate an encryption key using tr
   Elixir `Crypto` module.
3. Encrypt the message using the key and the Web Cryptography API.
4. Send the encrypted message to the server.
5. On the server, store the encrypted message in the database.
6. When the user wants to decrypt the message, use the password to
   generate the encryption key.
7. Use the Web Cryptography API to decrypt the message and display
   to the user.
8. Use the `window.localStorage` API or a library like `js-cookie` to
   securely store the key on the user's device.

### Encrypting and decrypting messages

To implement end-to-end encryption with Elixir, you will need to use a library that provides the necessary encryption and decryption functions. Some examples of libraries that can be used for this purpose are the Comeonin library for password hashing and the Cipher library for symmetric-key encryption.

Here is an example of how you might use these libraries to implement end-to-end encryption in a Phoenix Liveview application:

In your mix.exs file, add the comeonin and cipher dependencies:

```elixir

defp deps do
  [
    {:comeonin, "~> 5.1"},
    {:cipher, "~> 0.6.0"}
  ]
end
```

In your Liveview component, generate a random encryption key using the Cipher.random_key/0 function. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt your messages:

```elixir

def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  # Generate a random encryption key
  key = Cipher.random_key()

  # Store the key in the socket's assigns
  {:ok, assign(socket, key: key)}
end
```

When a user enters a message, encrypt it using the Cipher.encrypt/3 function and the encryption key stored in the socket's assigns:

```elixir

def handle_event("send_message", %{"message" => message}, socket) do
  # Retrieve the encryption key from the socket's assigns
  key = socket.assigns.key

  # Encrypt the message using the key
  encrypted_message = Cipher.encrypt(message, key)

  # Do something with the encrypted message...

  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

When a message is received, decrypt it using the Cipher.decrypt/2 function and the encryption key stored in the socket's assigns:

```elixir

def handle_info(%{message: encrypted_message}, socket) do
  # Retrieve the encryption key from the socket's assigns
  key = socket.assigns.key

  # Decrypt the message using the key
  message = Cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message, key)

  # Do something with the decrypted message...

  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

This is a basic example of how to use the comeonin and cipher libraries to implement end-to-end encryption in a Phoenix Liveview application. Keep in mind that this is just one way of achieving this goal and that there are many other libraries and approaches that can be used to implement end-to-end encryption in Elixir.

End-to-end encryption is a method of secure communication where only the sender and the intended recipient can read the message. This is achieved by encrypting the message on the sender's device and only the recipient's device has the decryption key to unlock and read the message.

In the case of implementing end-to-end encrypted messaging with Elixir, there are a few different approaches you could take. One approach would be to use a third-party encryption library, such as the decrypt package, which provides an easy-to-use API for encrypting and decrypting messages.

To use decrypt in your Elixir application, you would first need to add it as a dependency in your mix.exs file. Then, you would need to generate a secret key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt your messages. This key should be kept secret and should not be shared with anyone else.

Once you have your secret key, you can use the Decrypt.encrypt/2 function to encrypt a message and the Decrypt.decrypt/2 function to decrypt a message. For example:

```elixir
secret_key = "abc123"

# Encrypt a message
encrypted_message = Decrypt.encrypt("hello world", secret_key)
# => { :ok, %Decrypt.EncryptedMessage{...} }

# Decrypt a message
Decrypt.decrypt(encrypted_message, secret_key)
# => { :ok, "hello world" }
```

Once you have implemented the encryption and decryption functions in your application, you can use them to securely send and receive messages between users.

```elixir

Here is an example of implementing end-to-end encrypted messaging with LiveView in Elixir:

defmodule MyApp.Live.EncryptedMessaging do
  use Phoenix.LiveView

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, assign(socket, encrypted_messages: [])}
  end

  # Generate a new key pair for each user and store it in the socket state
  def init(socket) do
    {:ok, key_pair} = KeyPair.generate()
    {:ok, assign(socket, key_pair: key_pair)}
  end

  # When a new message is received, encrypt it using the recipient's public key
  # and append it to the list of encrypted messages
  def handle_info({:new_message, recipient_public_key, message}, socket) do
    encrypted_message = KeyPair.encrypt(recipient_public_key, message)
    {:noreply, assign(socket, encrypted_messages: encrypted_messages ++ [encrypted_message])}
  end

  # When a user wants to view a message, decrypt it using their private key
  def handle_event("view_message", %{"index" => index}, socket) do
    encrypted_message = socket.assigns.encrypted_messages[index]
    decrypted_message = KeyPair.decrypt(socket.assigns.key_pair.private_key, encrypted_message)
    {:noreply, assign(socket, decrypted_message: decrypted_message)}
  end

  # In the view, display the decrypted message when the user clicks on it
  def render(assigns) do
    ...
    ul do
      for encrypted_message <- assigns.encrypted_messages do
        li do
          button(
            "view_message",
            index: encrypted_message.index,
            onclick: "viewMessage(#{encrypted_message.index})"
          )
          if assigns.decrypted_message && assigns.decrypted_message.index == encrypted_message.index do
            div(class: "decrypted-message") do
              text(assigns.decrypted_message.text)
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ...
  end
end
```

In this example, we use the KeyPair module to generate a new key pair for each user and store it in the LiveView socket state. When a new message is received, it is encrypted using the recipient's public key and added to the list of encrypted messages. When a user wants to view a message, it is decrypted using their private key and displayed in the view.

## How to save this

In order to save encrypted messages in Elixir, you would need to first encrypt the message using a suitable encryption library such as comeonin. The encrypted message can then be saved to a database using Ecto, or written to a file using the File module in Elixir. When retrieving the encrypted message, it can be decrypted using the same encryption library and the original message can be displayed to the user.

Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented using Phoenix LiveView:

```elixir

defmodule MyApp.EncryptedMessageLive do
  use Phoenix.LiveView

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
    <form phx-change="save" phx-submit="save">
      <label>
        Message:
        <input type="text" phx-value="message" />
      </label>
      <button>Save</button>
    </form>
    """
  end

  def handle_event("save", %{"message" => message}, socket) do
    # encrypt the message using `comeonin`
    encrypted_message = Comeonin.Bcrypt.encrypt_password(message)

    # save the encrypted message to the database using Ecto
    Repo.insert(%MyApp.EncryptedMessage{message: encrypted_message})

    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

In the code above, the mount/3 function simply sets up the LiveView and returns the socket. The render/1 function renders the form where the user can enter the message to be saved. When the form is submitted, the handle_event/3 function is called and the save event is triggered. In the handle_event/3 function, the entered message is encrypted using the comeonin library and then saved to the database using Ecto.

To retrieve the encrypted message and display it to the user, you could add another LiveView module and modify the render/1 and handle_event/3 functions as follows:

```elixir

defmodule MyApp.EncryptedMessageLive do
  use Phoenix.LiveView

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    # fetch the encrypted message from the database
    encrypted_message = Repo.get(MyApp.EncryptedMessage, 1).message

    # decrypt the message using `comeonin`
    decrypted_message = Comeonin.Bcrypt.decrypt_password(encrypted_message)

    # assign the decrypted message to the socket
    {:ok, assign(socket, message: decrypted_message)}
  end

  def render(assigns) do
    # display the decrypted message to the user
    ~L"""
    <p>Message: <%= @message %></p>
    """
  end
end
```

In the mount/3 function, the encrypted message is fetched from the database and then decrypted using comeonin. The decrypted message is then assigned to the socket and passed to the render/1 function. In the render/1 function, the decrypted message is displayed to the user.
