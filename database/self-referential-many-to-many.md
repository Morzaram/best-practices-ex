To create a self-referential many-to-many relationship with Ecto, you need to define a schema that has a many-to-many relationship with itself. This can be useful in cases where you have a data model that has a hierarchical structure, such as a tree, and you want to be able to traverse the tree in both directions.

Here is an example of how you might define a schema for a tree-like data model in Ecto:

```elixir
defmodule Tree do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "trees" do
    field :name, :string
    many_to_many :children, Tree, join_through: "trees_children"
  end
end
```

In this example, the Tree schema has a many-to-many relationship with itself, which is defined by the many_to_many macro. The join_through option specifies the name of the intermediate join table that will be used to store the relationships between parent and child nodes in the tree.

Once you have defined your schema, you can use Ecto's Repo module to insert, update, and query your tree data. For example, to insert a new root node into the tree, you can use the Repo.insert/2 function like this:

```elixir
%Tree{name: "Root"} |> Repo.insert()
```

To add a child node to an existing parent node, you can use the Repo.preload/2 and Repo.update/2 functions like this:

```elixir
parent = Repo.get(Tree, parent_id)
child = %Tree{name: "Child"}

Repo.preload(parent, :children)
Repo.update(parent, [children: [child | parent.children]])
```

To query the tree and retrieve all of the child nodes of a given parent node, you can use the Repo.all/2 function like this:

```elixir
parent = Repo.get(Tree, parent_id)
Repo.all(from c in Tree, where: c.id in ^parent.children)
```

With these basic examples, you should have a good starting point for creating self-referential many-to-many relationships with Ecto in your Elixir application.
