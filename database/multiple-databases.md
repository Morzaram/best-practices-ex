To connect to multiple databases in Ecto, you can create multiple database connections and specify which connection to use when performing database operations.

Here is an example of how this might work:

First, you would define the database connections in your config/config.exs file:

```elixir

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  hostname: "localhost",
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "my_app_db"

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo1,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  hostname: "localhost",
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "my_app_db1"
```

In this example, we have defined two database connections: MyApp.Repo and MyApp.Repo1. These connections can be used to connect to different databases on the same server, or to connect to different servers entirely.

Next, you would specify which database connection to use in your schema modules. For example:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Query

  schema "users" do
    # ...
  end

  def by_name(name) do
    from u in MyApp.User,
    where: u.name == ^name
  end

  @db_conn :my_app
  @derive [Repo]
end

defmodule MyApp.Group do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Query

  schema "groups" do
    # ...
  end

  def by_name(name) do
    from u in MyApp.Group,
    where: u.name == ^name
  end

  @db_conn :my_app1
  @derive [Repo]
end
```

In this example, we have defined two schema modules: MyApp.User and MyApp.Group. The @db_conn annotation is used to specify which database connection to use for each schema. In this case, MyApp.User uses the MyApp.Repo connection, and MyApp.Group uses the MyApp.Repo1 connection.

Once the schema modules are defined, you can use them to perform database operations using the appropriate database connection. For example:

```elixir
# Use the MyApp.Repo connection to query the "users" table
users = MyApp.User.by_name("John") |> Repo.all()

# Use the MyApp.Repo1 connection to query the "groups" table
groups = MyApp.Group.by_name("Group 1") |> Repo.all()
```

This allows you to easily connect to and query multiple databases in your Ecto application.
