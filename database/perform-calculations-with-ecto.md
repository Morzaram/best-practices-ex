One way to perform calculations on your model data with Ecto is to use the Ecto.Query.select/3 function. This function allows you to specify the fields you want to include in your query, as well as any transformations or calculations you want to perform on those fields.

For example, suppose you have a model called Post that has fields for title and views. You can use Ecto.Query.API.select/3 to calculate the total number of views for all the posts in your database like this:

```elixir
query = from p in Post,
         select: %{title: p.title, views: sum(p.views)}

posts = Repo.all(query)
```

This will return a list of maps, each of which contains the title of a post and the total number of views for that post. You can then use the resulting data to generate reports, display statistics, or perform other calculations as needed.

It is also possible to perform more complex calculations using the Ecto.Query.API.group_by/3 and Ecto.Query.API.having/2 functions. These functions allow you to group your data by one or more fields, and then apply additional filters or calculations to the groups. For example, you could use Ecto.Query.API.group_by/3 and Ecto.Query.API.having/2 to calculate the average number of views per post for each user, like this:

```elixir

query = from p in Post,
         group_by: p.user_id,
         having: avg(p.views) > 100,
         select: %{user_id: p.user_id, average_views: avg(p.views)}

users = Repo.all(query)
```

This will return a list of maps, each of which contains the user_id of a user and the average number of views per post for that user. Only users who have an average of more than 100 views per post will be included in the results.

Overall, Ecto provides a powerful and flexible set of tools for performing calculations on your model data. By using the functions in the Ecto.Query.API module, you can easily create complex queries that extract and transform your data in a variety of ways.

Here are a few more examples of how you can use Ecto to perform calculations on your model data:

    Calculate the total number of comments for each post: Suppose you have a model called Post that has a many-to-one relationship with a Comment model. You can use Ecto.Query.select/3 to calculate the total number of comments for each post like this:

```elixir

query = from p in Post,
         join: c in assoc(p, :comments),
         group_by: p.id,
         select: %{title: p.title, comments: count(c.id)}

posts = Repo.all(query)
```

This will return a list of maps, each of which contains the title of a post and the total number of comments for that post.

    Calculate the average rating for each product: Suppose you have a model called Product that has a many-to-one relationship with a Review model. You can use Ecto.Query.select/3 to calculate the average rating for each product like this:

```elixir

query = from p in Product,
         join: r in assoc(p, :reviews),
         group_by: p.id,
         select: %{name: p.name, rating: avg(r.rating)}

products = Repo.all(query)
```

This will return a list of maps, each of which contains the name of a product and the average rating for that product.

    Calculate the total number of pages read for each user: Suppose you have a model called User that has a many-to-one relationship with a Book model. You can use Ecto.Query.select/3 to calculate the total number of pages read for each
