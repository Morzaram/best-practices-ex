In Ecto, polymorphic associations allow a single model to belong to multiple other models using a single association. This can be useful when you want to create relationships between models in a way that is flexible and reusable.

To create a polymorphic association in Ecto, you can use the belongs_to :other, polymorphic: true option in your schema. Here is an example of how this might work:

First, you would define the schemas for the two models that you want to create a polymorphic association between. Let's say you have a comments model and a posts model. In the comments schema, you would use the belongs_to association to define the polymorphic relationship with the posts model:

```elixir

defmodule MyApp.Comment do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "comments" do
    belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
  end
end
```

In the posts schema, you would use the has_many association to define the relationship with the comments model:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "posts" do
    has_many :comments, MyApp.Comment
  end
end
```

Then, to create a polymorphic association between a comment and a post, you would first create a new comment and a new post, and then use the Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc/3 function to associate the two:

```elixir

# Create a new comment and a new post
comment = %Comment{}
|> Comment.changeset(%{body: "This is a great post!"})
|> Repo.insert()

post = %Post{}
|> Post.changeset(%{title: "My Favorite Post"})
|> Repo.insert()

# Associate the comment with the post using `put_assoc/3`
comment_changeset =
  Comment.changeset(comment, %{})
  |> Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc(:commentable, post)

Repo.update(comment_changeset)
```

This will create a new polymorphic association between the comment and the post, allowing you to easily retrieve and manage the relationship in your code.

Polymorphic associations can be useful because they allow you to create relationships between models in a flexible and reusable way. They can also make your code more organized and maintainable, since you can use the same association for
